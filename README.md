# PokerPredict1v1
The following .cpp file, needs the input of what three cards lie on the table, and the two cards you have in your hand. It then calculates the number of possibilities for which your hand is better than the opponent's hand. This can be used to guide a game engine into making decisions as it can take into account the probability of loss, and hence make optimal decisions.
